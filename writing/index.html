          <h3>Practical Forgiveness</h3>
          <p>
            If wrath and love are two of the most powerful emotions, or states of being (to be more accurate),
            where does the act of forgiving fit? In the middle of love and hate? Probably not. Then one must wonder,
            what is the use of forgiving? Or, why would there be a need to forgive?

          <h3>On Writing: A Terrifying Phenomenon</h3>
          <p>
            One might think of writing as a peaceful, calming act. Although that is true, sometimes, the essence of writing is not quite peaceful.
            It is brutal if done truthfully. Writing, in all its forms, could be a means of exploration. Any uninformed exploration could be dangerous.

            One can simply look into what one consumes on a daily basis, and then question why one would consume those particular items rather
            than other things. For example, one can wonder, “Why am I having bread in my breakfast every morning?”

            I guess we can all agree that having a full stomach is the most basic need, not a desire that any species could close their eyes on
            in order to achieve the ultimate happiness. Now, what happens when one’s basic need is satisfied?

            Of course we eat mostly because we need the required energy to go through the day. But that’s only one reason human eats.
            In this modern age, most of the population feed on sugar for different reasons. Carbohydrates are easy to get; they are cheap.
