            Smile and laughter are sacred. Not only their appearance are beautiful but also their underlying structure is heavenly.
            How joyful it is to smile at the beauty of nature and its perfection.
            It is perfect indeed, for there is no alternative to such splendid beauty.

            If wrath and love are two of the most powerful emotions, or states of being (to be more accurate),
            where does the act of forgiving fit? In the middle of love and hate? Probably not. Then one must wonder,

            One might think of writing as a peaceful, calming act. Although that is true, sometimes, the essence of writing is not quite peaceful.
            It is brutal if done truthfully. Writing, in all its forms, could be a means of exploration. Any uninformed exploration could be dangerous.

            One can simply look into what one consumes on a daily basis, and then question why one would consume those particular items rather
            than other things. For example, one can wonder, “Why am I having bread in my breakfast every morning?”
